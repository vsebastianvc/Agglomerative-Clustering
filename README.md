# About Project 

In our project I collaborated researching about Hierarchical Clustering to use this method to find what are the causes of death depend the age in a large dataset. We start doing a data quality in the whole dataset to optimize the results, after that I load into R to find the correlation between the features respect to the age. Finally, I selected the strong rules/relation about the most common reason of death.
